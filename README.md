# 4D-Simulator
The 4DP Simulator is a simulator that shows the results of the output by applying specific processing to the 3D printout.
The 4DP Simulator uses Microsoft Windows MFC as the platform and renders the model through OpenGL. It is a C ++ console application developed with Visual Studio 2015.
- OS : Mocrosoft Windows 10 MFC C++
- Rendering : OpenGL
- Simulation : SIEMENS Parasolid
- Data chart : Chart Directory
We implemented the position transformation, model information, and collision detection of the model using Parasolid, a geometric kernel used in NX.
The .csv file that the user uses as the data of the kinetic component is displayed graphically through the Chart Directory.
